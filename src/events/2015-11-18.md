summary: |
  SUPER IMPORTANT: WE'RE AT [THE STORY MUSEUM](http://www.storymuseum.org.uk) THIS MONTH

  Here's some reasons why November is totally brilliant:

  1. We'll be moving to Story Museum; which is lovely, cosy, nice & awesome. We don't have parking anymore, though it's easy to get in from the Redbridge Park and Ride; and it's a lot closer to the train station.

  2. It's our 3rd birthday (that's 21 years old in javascript years). We'll have a bit of time to talk about where we've been, and where we're going with JSOxford (hint: brilliant places)

  3. We've got some great speakers (story-tellers) this month; Monica, Max and Peter.

    description: |
      In recent years there have been incredible advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning. As a result, powerful technology which used to be rare and expensive has very quickly become easily available and cheap. This will have both positive and negative consequences for web developers. In this talk I will look at how AI will change the development field, and provide techniques that will help designers and developers to work with AI to improve their skills and make better sites and applications for end users.
