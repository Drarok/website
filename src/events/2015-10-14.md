  For a long time Javascript didn't exist, then for a relatively short time it was only in browsers, but now it's, like, everywhere.

  We're going to talk about some of the places that javascript is, that aren't a browser.

    description: |
      Learn how I scratched my own itch and shipped an MVP cross platform desktop app in 5 days. I'll be sharing my battles with Windows and how I struggled to the last hour to get installers and auto-updating in (plus my solutions). This talk contains lots of code, coffee, javascript, angular all wrapped up in electron. Essentially every tool a pretentious hipster would use if they were shipping an app.
