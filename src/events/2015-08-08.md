  This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are interested in learning how to build interactive websites. Attendees should identify as a woman, and can bring a guest of any gender.

  Interested in learning how to program? Never written a line of code before and are a little intimidated by nerds? There's no need to be! RailsBridge is a friendly place to get together and learn how to write some code.

  Maybe you've written a little HTML and CSS before, or touched on Ruby or programming. Maybe you're completely new to this and ready for a challenge. All you need to attend is a laptop* and enthusiasm (*get in touch if you can't get hold of a laptop and we'll see what we can do).

  We'll have some of the amazing people from New Bamboo (https://www.new-bamboo.co.uk/) on hand alongside the JSOxford and OxRUG volunteers, so there's plenty of help and mentorship available.

  We'll have tea, coffee, snacks and drinks available throughout the day, as well as pastries in the morning and burritos for lunch. Please get in touch if you have any special dietary requirements and we'll sort you out.

  We have two tracks: Frontend and Ruby on Rails. Programmers of all skill levels are welcome.

  ### Ruby on Rails track

  In this track we'll take you through building a complete web application using Ruby on Rails. By the end of the day, you'll have an application that connects to a database and reads and writes information. Even better, it'll be on the internet! You can see the activities for this track here (http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/). Don't forget to come to the Friday InstallFest (see below).

  ### Frontend track

  The Frontend track is all about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We'll be building webpages, making them look *amazing*, and adding dynamic behaviour using JavaScript (click here (http://docs.railsbridge.org/frontend/) to see the course syllabus) The only thing you need for this track is a text editor and the web browser you already use! Please download and install a programming text editor (Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or Atom (https://atom.io/) are a good choice). Don't forget to come to the Friday InstallFest (see below).

  ### Friday evening InstallFest

  There's a lot to learn on Saturday, so it would be really helpful if everyone is set-up and ready to go. We'll meet up on Friday evening to install all of the software you need (or work through any problems you've had installing), and then spend Saturday learning and writing code.

  If you can run through the InstallFest (http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/) steps prior to attending that's also great. Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the day, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.
