address: St Aldates Tavern, 108 St. Aldate's Oxford, Oxfordshire, OX1 1BU
summary: |
  December is a busy month for everyone, so instead of talks, join us at St Aldates Tavern for drinking and/or festive, nerdy conversation.

  We've heard rumours of Espruino powered LED christmas jumpers, the 24 PRs of Christmas and an unhealthy amount of Emoji.

  Find us in the main pub area, taking up as much space as possible!
