title: "Summer of Hacks #4: Hardware"
date: 2016-09-17
address: The Story Museum, Rochester House, 42 Pembroke St, Oxford, OX11BP
summary: |
  This is a day of hacking on hardware. We'll have some kits, complete with Espruino boards and components, to play with and you're welcome to bring any additional hardware or things you'd like to hack.

  Who is this event for?

  Anyone interested in learning a bit about hardware. There are no minimum entry requirements, other than an inquisitive mind. If you've never touched a breadboard before, that's fine â€“ we have some starter kits and plenty of helpful people to guide you. If you're a bit more experienced that's great too, as you'll get to play with some new kit or hack on a project with like-minded people.

  ### Food

  We'll be providing pastries from a local patisserie, and a burrito lunch. You'll get to build your own burrito/box. We'll also have a selection of fruits and snacks, teas and coffees.

  If you have any concerns about dietary requirements (or any questions whatsoever) get in touch.

  ### What isn't this event?

  This isn't a competition, race or hackathon. There will be no prizes, other than basking in your own glory as you learn new things, meet new people, and have a good time.
