summary: |
  We're taking a bit of a break from our usual structure this month for something a bit less formal.

  Join us at St. Aldates Tavern from 7pm for drinks and chat about life, love and JavaScript. If you're new to JavaScript (and JSOxford) or a regular, it's a great chance to meet and catch up.

  See you there.
