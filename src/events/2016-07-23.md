  ### What is a hack day?

  A hack day is an event where people come together to collaborate on interesting ideas and learn new technologies. People usually organise themselves into teams, work on a project and then demo it at the end of the day. Hack days work best when there's a relaxed, open and friendly atmosphere.

  ### Who is this event for?

  Anyone who is interested in games or VR is welcome.If you can write code or draw pictures, that's a bonus!

  ### What will I need?

  • You'll need a laptop and charger. If you don't have access to a laptop let us know and we'll do our best to sort you out.

  • Bring your smartphone for VR or to use as a controller.

  • Also, bring a VR headset if you have one!

  ### What technologies are we using?

  We will be focussing on web technologies: HTML and Javascript.

  We'll have mentors who can help with libraries such as:

  • ThreeJS (3D scenes in javascript)

  • AFrame (Simple VR experiences)

  • Phaser (Game making framework)

  We'll have beginner tutorials & example projects for these technologies, to get you started.

  Feel free to try other tools and technologies, we will help wherever we can!

  When we get set up you'll have the chance to pair up with another attendee or embark on a workshop on your own. We'll have mentors on-hand to help if you get stuck or give you suggestions on workshops you might like.

  ### Food

  We'll be providing pastries from a local patisserie, and a burrito lunch. You'll get to build your own burrito/box. We'll also have a selection of fruits and snacks, teas and coffees.

  If you have any concerns about dietary requirements (or any questions whatsoever) get in touch.
