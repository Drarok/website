summary: JavaScript runs on nearly everything these days and because of this, nearly everything compiles to JavaScript. This month we'll be taking a look at two languages that generate JavaScript - PureScript and TypeScript.

      Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a style of programming based on event streams such as system clock ticks, network traffic, or even keyboard input. In this talk we'll use [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/), a compile-to-JS language, to explore the concepts of FRP, learn a little bit of functional programming, and build one or two exciting examples!

      TypeScript is a language that extends JavaScript to support static typing.
      It complements the open, malleable design principles of JavaScript, while catching bugs and improving code understandability.
      In this talk, you'll learn how to use TypeScript in your existing project and how you can iteratively improve your code with stronger typing.
