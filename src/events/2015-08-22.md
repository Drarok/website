address: White October, 3 The Gallery, 54 Marston Street, OX4 1LF, Oxford
summary: |
  The JSOxHack is a full-day hack event to play with the technologies we've learned over summer, or anything else that interests us.

  This is not a hackathon or competition, and there are no prizes. Instead it's a chance to hack with great people on interesting things. We'll start the day with a round of pitches, so if you've got any ideas bring them along. If you're just keen to take part there will be plenty of groups, and we've got mentors around all day to guide and support you.

  ### Who should come?

  Everyone! If you can write a bit of JavaScript you'll fit right in. We'll have plenty of mentors to help and guide you throughout the day, and the aim of the event is to have a good time.

  ### What do I need to bring?

  All you'll need is your own laptop (if you don't have one, just get in touch with us in advance and we'll do our best to sort you out).

  If you have any leftovers from a previous event, components, devices or things you'd like to hack on, bring them along!
