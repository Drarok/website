  We’re going to kick off 2016 big-style on February 17th at the Story Museum. There will be talks, drinks, people, and tonnes of fun.

  This month we’ve got Mike talking about offline web technologies, which is going to be pretty cool. And we’ve also got a community/collaborative/helpful/ supportive/lovely/nice/great show and tell session where we can share what we’ve been working on (or, what someone else has been working on, and you think is great).
