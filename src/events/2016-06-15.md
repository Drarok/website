      Service Workers are the biggest thing to hit the browser since XMLHttpRequest. We'll take a look at what the Service Worker can do for your app and more importantly, your users. We'll see the surprisingly small amount of code you need to get started with a Service Worker and finally we'll take a look at Progressive Web Apps and how the Service Worker will take part in a revolution for web applications.

      WARNING: This talk features dangerous levels of impracticality.

      Have you ever wondered how far you could get if all you had were functions? Probably not, you have better things to do with your time, but fear not, I don't. Join me on an adventure as we rebuild familiar concepts like booleans, if expressions, numbers, pairs, and lists, from functions alone.

      Ashok is a computer scientist who sometimes pretends to be a software engineer. He likes functional programming, type theory and long walks on the beach, and dislikes the misappropriation of mathematical terms (I'm looking at you, "isomorphic" javascript). He also still believes people (deep, deep down) want to use mathematical proofs in industry, so nobody break his bubble.
