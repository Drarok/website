date: 2016-08-27
address: The Story Museum, Rochester House, 42 Pembroke St, Oxford, OX11BP
summary: |
  A CodeRetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. Developers can disconnect from constraints like time and feature pressure, and just focus on the craft of programming. You don't have to ship anything. Just practice.

  You will be guided through the day by a facilitator. At the beginning of the day we'll explain all the details!

  This is a very rough schedule, and we'll adjust the timings and number of sessions to match everyone's energy.

  For a bit of background about CodeRetreat, check out this [video](https://vimeo.com/18955165).

  ### Food

  We'll be providing pastries from a local patisserie, and a burrito lunch. You'll get to build your own burrito/box. We'll also have a selection of fruits and snacks, teas and coffees.

  If you have any concerns about dietary requirements (or any questions whatsoever) get in touch.

  ### What isn't this event?

  This isn't a competition, race or hackathon. There will be no prizes, and no-one will be judged on the code they write.
