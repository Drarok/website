  ### Who is this event for? Everyone!

  • I've never programmed JavaScript. The workshops start from scratch, no programming experience required. We have some helpful volunteers to help you throughout the day.

  • I know some JavaScript. Excellent, you're in the right place too. There are some more advanced themes (http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) to work through.

  • I know all of that!. Even better! NodeSchool is an open source project, so we can build up some new materials. We've got some ideas, or come along with your own.

  When we get set up you'll have the chance to pair up with another attendee or embark on a workshop on your own. We'll have mentors on-hand to help if you get stuck or give you suggestions on workshops you might like.

  ### Food

  We'll be providing pastries from a local patisserie, and a burrito lunch. You'll get to build your own burrito/box. We'll also have a selection of fruits and snacks, teas and coffees.

  If you have any concerns, questions or special dietary requirements (or any questions whatsoever) please get in touch with us beforehand so we can cater appropriately.

  ### What isn't this event?

  This isn't a competition, race or hackathon. There will be no prizes, other than basking in your own glory as you learn new things, meet new people, and have a good time.
