address: White October, 3 The Gallery, 54 Marston Street, OX4 1LF, Oxford
summary: |
  his month we're having a super-mega-meetup with [OxRUG](http://oxrug.org/) and the [Oxford Python Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/oxfordpython/) to look at open data and how we can leverage and contribute to global datasets. Open data is great in theory, but how can we go about actually using it, and what are the practical implications? Hopefully we'll find out!
