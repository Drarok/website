  ### Who should come?

  Everyone! There are workshops (http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list) for different abilities, and we'll have plenty of mentors to help and guide you throughout the day.

  ### What do I need to bring?

  All you'll need is your own laptop (if you don't have one, just get in touch with us in advance and we'll do our best to sort you out), and it will help if nodejs is already installed.

  We'll have tea, coffee, snacks and drinks available throughout the day, as well as pastries in the morning and burritos for lunch. Please get in touch if you have any special dietary requirements and we'll sort you out.
