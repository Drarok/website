    title: "[Max Glenister](https://twitter.com/omgmog) - Cardboctober: Making VR experiences for Google Cardboard with JavaScript daily in October"
    description: |
      In October Ben, Pete and Max built something every day for Google Cardboard using Javascript.

      In this talk Max will talk about how he planned and executed a month of hacks, what worked (and what didn't!) and what he got out of the challenge.

    title: "[Roger Noble](https://twitter.com/Roger_Noble) - Make your UI flexible with a plugin architecture, featuring React"
    description: |
      When building Zegami (a data visualisation tool [http://www.zegami.com](http://www.zegami.com/)) we wanted to allow anyone to be able to add their own custom functionality and enhancements. This presented a challenge for us to construct an interface - both visually and in code, that developers could approach with a minimal learning curve.

      This talk will discuss some of the decisions we made as well as a practical demonstration of how this same approach could be used in any application.
