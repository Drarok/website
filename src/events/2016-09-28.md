date: 2016-09-28
address: The Story Museum, Rochester House, 42 Pembroke St, Oxford, OX11BP
summary: |
  ðŸŒŸ This month we'll be joining forces with [PHPOxford](https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Oxford/events/233030813/)! We'll be at the same venue - though with an even wider, super-er group of developers! Head over to their [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/PHP-Oxford/events/233030813/) and sign up too. ðŸŒŸ

  We're possibly a month early, though more probably a month late; either way we're going to get together and talk it all through.

  We'll be having an evening of talks & chats in the Story Museum; this month we're really lucky to have [Chris Hoult](https://twitter.com/choult) joining us to talk about Ethical Engineering (a really interesting topic). We're also looking for a second talk, so if there's something you'd like to talk about - please get in touch.

  Come along to learn some stuff, talk to friendly people and have a drink or two. (Big thanks to [HaybrookIT](https://haybrook.co.uk/) for sponsoring the venue hire and refreshments.)

  If you've been along to any of the summer of hacks events - this is a great opportunity to come back and catch up with the people you met.

    title: "[Katy Anton](https://twitter.com/katyanton) - OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls"
    description: |
      Cyber attacks are a real and growing threat to businesses and an increasing number of attacks take place at application layer. The best defence against is to develop applications where security is incorporated as part of the software development lifecycle.

      The OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls project is designed to integrate security in the software development lifecycle. In this presentation based on v2.0 released this year, you will learn how to incorporate security into your software projects.

      Recommended to all developers who want to learn the security techniques that can help them build more secure applications.

    title: "[Chris Hoult](https://twitter.com/choult) - Ethical Engineering"
    description: |
      Our increasingly connected world, along with the promises of Big Data and Cloud Computing, offers us multitudes of opportunities to model the world and build powerful technology to improve not only the companies we work for but the lives of many. Yet far too often we, as engineers, focus on providing a solution to the problem at hand and overlook the problems that the solution itself might cause. In this talk, Christopher examines some of the issues our world throws up, and asks what it takes to engineer ethically.
