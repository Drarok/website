<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  JSOxford is a community of JavaScript enthusiasts that comes together once a month to learn, share and socialize.
</p>

<p>
  JSOxford can only operate thanks to the kind support of our sponsors. Sponsors help us cover costs including, but not limited to, venue hire, event insurance, refreshments and recurring subscriptions costs (such as Meetup.com and domain name).
</p>

<h2>Sponsoring JSOxford</h2>

<p>
  We generally look for about <strong>Â£600</strong> per event to cover the cost of the venue, insurance and refreshments. We will aim for one or two sponsors per event so the costs can be split between sponsors.
</p>

<p>
  Occasionally we may run special events, such as workshops or hack days, which have more costs involved. These are generally full day events that include breakfast (pastries) and lunch. If you would like to sponsor one of these events we encourage you to email us at <a href="mailto:sponsorship@jsoxford.com">sponsorship@jsoxford.com</a> to discuss it.
</p>

<p>
  All sponsors must abide by our <a href="/codeofconduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4>Will we be able to talk to attendees?</h4>

<p>
  Sponsors will get two minutes to speak to the audience about their company. They are also free to speak with attendees during breaks.
</p>

<h4>Where does the sponsorship money go?</h4>

<p>
  Sponsorship money goes to pay our runing costs: venue hire, event insurance, refreshments and recurring fees. Sponsorship money may also go towards speaker travel (where applicable). Left over money will be carried over to future events, donated to charity or used to help support local community efforts.
</p>

<h4>Can we have a speaker the same month that we sponsor?</h4>

<p>
  We prefer not to have a speaker from your company giving a talk the same month you are sponsoring. However we do encourage you to speak with us about it and we can look at arranging speaking another month.
</p>

<h3>Do you offer non-monetary sponsorship?</h3>

<p>
  Maybe! We encourage you to <a href="mailto:sponsorship@jsoxford.com">get in touch</a> with us to discuss it.
