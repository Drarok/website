  <a href="/{{lowerCase title}}/">Supporting JSOxford</a>
</h1>

<p>
  We've launched an <a href="https://opencollective.com/jsoxford">Open Collective</a> page for JSOxford (a service that allows open source projects and meetups to collect money and handle expenses in a transparent way) and we wanted to make it clear to the community why and what our aim with it is.
</p>

<p>
  First of all I want to make it clear that <strong>there are no plans to make JSOxford a paid-for event</strong>. We do all this completely for the benefit of the community and do not expect any money back.
</p>

<p>
  To understand our decision to use Open Collective you first need a little background on how JSOxford is run. JSOxford is not its own legal entity. There is no company setup to run JSOxford or handle its finances as no profits are to be made. While this frees us from the burden of accountancy and taxes it does limit how we work with sponsors. As such, we are unable to raise an invoice to collect sponsorship money from organisations. We must rely either on them paying expenses directly or small petty cash contributions. Because of this we are limited in what we are able to do.
</p>

<p>
  Our sponsors have been great with us so far at working around these issues but it is an hassle that we would rather do without when organising events. Because of this we chose to setup an Open Collective account so we could collect sponsorship through that without the need for us being setup as a company. This also has the added benefit of our <a href="https://opencollective.com/jsoxford#budget">transactions</a> being in the open for the community to see.
</p>

<p>
  This service isn't free, Open Collective takes a percentage (10% + transaction fees) of the money contributed to each account. This fee is taken on each contribution and there are no ongoing or up-front costs making it much more manageable for us to work with.
</p>

<p>
  An Open Collective allows anyone to contribute, not just sponsors. Contributions can be made as one offs or ongoing monthly support. Again, we do not expect this from our members but if anyone does decide they want to support us we wanted to make it clear what that money could contribute towards:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Event costs - venue, drinks, snacks</li>
  <li>Meetup.com fees</li>
  <li>jsoxford.com domain costs</li>
  <li>Insurance</li>
  <li>Speaker travel expenses</li>
  <li>A/V equipment</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous running costs - laptop adapters, stickers, disposable tableware, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If we ever get into a position where we have surplus funds we will aim to donate it to an organisation such as <a href="https://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a>, <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a> or similar.
</p>

<p>
  Contribution by an organisation doesn't automatically equate to sponsorship of our events. Any company looking to sponsor us (and get the benefits that come with that) should <a href="mailto:organisers@jsoxford.com">contact us</a> first.
